		"Help! A monster!" said Annie.<br />
		"Yeah, sure," said Jack. "A real monster in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania."<br />
		"Run, Jack!" said Annie. She ran up the road.<br />
		Oh, brother.<br />
		This is what he got for spending time with his seven-year-old sister.<br />
		Annie loved pretend stuff. But Jack was eight and a half. He liked <i>real</i>things.<br />
		"Watch out, Jack! The monster's coming! Race you!"<br />
		"No, thanks," said Jack.<br />
		Annie raced alone into the woods.<br />
		Jack looked at the sky. The sun was about to set.<br />
		"Come on, Annie! It's time to go home!"<br />
		But Annie had disappeared.<br />
		Jack waited.<br />
		No Annie.<br />
		"Annie!" he shouted again.<br />
		"Jack! Jack! Come here!"<br />
		Jack groaned. "This better be good," he said.<br />
		Jack left the road and headed into the woods. The trees were lit with a golden late-afternoon light.<br />
		"Come here!" called Annie.<br />
		There she was. Standing under a tall oak tree. "Look," she said. She was pointing at a rope ladder.<br />
		The longest rope ladder Jack had ever seen.<br />
		"Wow," he whispered.<br />
		The ladder went all the way up to the top of the tree.<br />
		There—at the top—was a tree house. It was tucked between two branches.<br />
		"That must be the highest tree house in the world," said Annie.<br />
		"Who built it?" asked Jack. "I've never seen it before."<br />
		"I don't know. But I'm going up," said Annie.<br />
		"No. We don't know who it belongs to," said Jack.<br />
		"Just for a teeny minute," said Annie. She started up the ladder.<br />
		"Annie, come back!"<br />
		She kept climbing.<br />
		Jack sighed. "Annie, it's almost dark. We have to go home."<br />
		Annie disappeared inside the tree house.<br />
		"An-nie!"<br />
		Jack waited a moment. He was about to call again when Annie poked her head out of the tree house window.<br />
		"Books!" she shouted.<br />
		"What?"<br />
		"It's filled with books!"<br />
		Oh, man! Jack loved books.<br />
		He pushed his glasses into place. He gripped the sides of the rope ladder, and up he went.
