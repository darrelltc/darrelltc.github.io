the second before you die.他的一生会闪过眼前
First of all...首先
...that one second isn't a second at all.其实不是一秒钟
It stretches on forever, like an ocean of time.而是延伸成无止尽的时间
For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp 对我来说我的一生是躺在草地
watching falling stars.看着流星雨
And yellow leaves from the maple trees that lined our street.还有街道上枯黄的枫叶
Or my grandmother's hands and the way her skin seemed like paper.或是奶奶手上像纸一样的皮

I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me,我猜我死了应该生气才对
but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world.但世界这么美 不该一直生气
Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much.有时候一次看完会无法承受
My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst.我的心像涨满的汽球随时会爆炸
And then I remember to relax 后来我记得要放轻松
and stop trying to hold on to it.别一直想要紧抓着不放
And then it flows through me like rain 所有的美就像雨水一样洗涤我
and I can't feel anything but gratitude 让我对我这卑微愚蠢的生命
for every single moment of my stupid little life.在每一刻都充满了感激
You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure.你一定不知道我在说什么
But don't worry.别担心
You will someday.有一天你会明白</p>
